# grunt-steroids

> Steroids CLI default Grunt tasks.

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process and we've published this to the NPM repository, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-steroids --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-steroids');
```

Note that the above line is included in your Steroids project's default `Gruntfile.js` and is required for `$ steroids connect` to work.

## The "steroids-make" task

Builds the `dist/` directory that is then packaged and sent to connected devices by Steroids CLI.

## Contributing
